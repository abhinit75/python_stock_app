# Python Stock App

The aim of this project would be to predict the future values of specific stocks using machine learning, display the predicted values and historical stock data visually.

Additonally, we can provide data summary to make it more human readable.

Upcoming Features:

1. User Authentication and Profiles: Implement user registration and authentication. This would allow users to save their preferred stocks, view their search history, and customize their dashboard. Flask-Dash offers integration with Flask-Login which can be used for this purpose.

2. Advanced Financial Metrics: You could display more financial indicators and metrics, such as P/E ratio, EPS, market cap, etc. This would add depth to the analysis you're providing.

3. Stock Comparison: Allow users to compare multiple stocks on the same graph. This would be particularly helpful for users looking to diversify their portfolio.

4. Interactive Charts: Enhance your data visualization with more interactive Plotly graphs. For instance, you could use candlestick charts for stock prices, which provides more information than a simple line plot.

5. Automated Reports: Give users the option to receive daily/weekly/monthly reports via email about their chosen stocks.

6. Real-time Data: Instead of making predictions on historical data only, provide real-time data and forecasts if possible.
